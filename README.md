# eCommerceSite

eCommerce site that I made using Python, Django framework with models, HTML, CSS

To run this program, first make a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv .venv
```
Then activate the virtual environment:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Then install Django:
```
pip install Django
```
To run the app:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
